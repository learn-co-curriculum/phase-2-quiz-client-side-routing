What are the benefits of client-side routing? (Select all that apply)

## Correct

Speed when navigating within the application.

> Correct! With client-side routing, we don't have to wait for a new HTML document
> and all its associated content to load whenever a user clicks a link to visit
> another page on our site.

## Correct

Programmatic navigation.

> Correct! Client-side routing makes it easier to programmatically navigate a user
> to a new page on our side.

## Correct

Conditionally rendering components based on the URL.

> Correct! Client-side routing makes it easier access data from the URL using
> JavaScript, so we can conditionally render different components based on the
> URL.

## Incorrect

Easier for analytical tools to track page views.

> Because there are typically less requests made to the server in client-side
> routing, this can make it more challenging to set up analytic tools to track
> data (like page views) from our routes.

## Incorrect

Faster initial page load.

> Client-side routing does have a longer initial page load, because it loads
> everything at the beginning, as opposed to when a route is requested.
