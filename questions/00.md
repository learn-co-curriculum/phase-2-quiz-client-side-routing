# Programmatic Navigation

Which hook gives us the ability to programmatically navigate the user to a new
page in our application?

## Correct

`useHistory`

> Correct! We use the
> [`useHistory`](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/usehistory) hook to
> access React Router's `history` object, which lets us navigate users to new
> pages with methods such as `.push()`.

## Incorrect

`useParams`

> We use the [`useParams`](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/useparams) hook
> to get the dynamic `params` from the URL.

## Incorrect

`useState`

> We use the [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
> hook to return a stateful value, and a function to update it.
